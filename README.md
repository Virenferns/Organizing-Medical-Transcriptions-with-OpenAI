# Project: Organizing Medical Transcriptions with OpenAI

# Objective: 
Built an AI-powered system to structure anonymized medical transcription data using OpenAI GPT for improved clinical data organization and analysis.

# Key Features & Techniques:

  Extracted age, medical specialty, and recommended treatment from raw transcription text using OpenAI API.
  Mapped recommended treatments to ICD codes for standardized medical classification.
  Stored structured outputs in a pandas DataFrame for easy querying and downstream analytics.
  Implemented prompt engineering for accurate entity extraction and classification.

# Outcome: 
Delivered a robust pipeline that transforms unstructured medical text into structured, ICD-coded data, enabling better insights and interoperability.
